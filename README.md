# My-Portfolio-Matthew-Jusuf

## Description

This project tests my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. This project forces me to not only learn the theory, but implement the topics and lessons that I've learned into something useful in real world. I hope that through this project, I would be able to further improve and practice my thought process as a coder. Through this project, I was able to learn on implementing HTML and CSS to create a real and working website. The most valuable lesson that I've learnt through this project is perhaps a problem solving skill. I've improved my skill in knowing what to google and how to find the answer to a problem through the internet.

## Installation

- Create a Git Repo
- Link the Repo to your local computer using the git clone command
- Create index.html in the root folder and create a style.css file in a subfolder
- Type in the basic structure of the website in the index.html using semantic
- Style the HTML using CSS by linking the 2 together
- Base the positioning of the content of the website using Flex and its properties
- Add :hover and :active animation to make website more interactive

## Usage

This website is meant to be an example of creating a basic interactive website that displays multiple "portfolios". The colors and fonts can easily be amended to suit a "client's" need.

The parts that are interactive are:
- The logo
- The nav bar
- The picture
- The logos under the work section

            <p>
                I'm Matthew, or Matt as most people call all Matthews - a regular guy trying to learn a new skill in IT especially in learning how to code.

                I was born in Australia, but was raised in Indonesia most of my life. Came to Australia in 2015 for Uni and now have decided to stay and build my career here.
                At this stage there are no portfolio yet that I can put in this website, however I hope that I can start adding things to this website as I go along this course.
